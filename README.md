# vidyo
Web app built with ffmpeg.wasm allowing users to quickly edit videos. Once basic editor is completed it will be bundled into an NPM package called vep.

Main goal is to create a lightweight npm package that is self reliant with no outside dependancies other than `ffmpeg.wasm` and a few other like `styled-components` etc.. Web application (vidyo) will be made for fun, but main focus will be the npm package (eventtually called vep).
